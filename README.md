# deploy

## Requirements 

- python3

## Running

Run with: 

```./report.py```

This script reads a diff file and then moves the files in the repo according to the git label. 

## Clean-up

`deployPackage` and subdirectories can be removed as they will be recreated. 

Once the src tree has been processed, you can remove it. 

If you need to recrete the src tree:

```tar xvf src.tar```
